## <ins>Introduction</ins>

This repo contains python programs that easily calculate simple statistical patterns. The program starts with the following **main menu**.



If a calculation is required, select the relevant subject from the main menu and start entering the data set. After entering the data set and the desired information, the calculation result will be given as output on the command line.

## <ins>Requirements</ins>

To analyze data with Python, certain libraries are needed.

- First, python version 3.3 and above must be installed on your device. To check this, use the `python --version` command via cmd or terminal. If it is not installed, python must be installed on the device <ins>**absolutely**</ins>.
- To install all the necessary libraries at once, go to the project directory in **terminal or cmd** with the `cd` command and run this code. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- If the programs are still not working, check the libraries in **requirements.txt**: `pip show libraryName` to check if they are installed.
- If not, install them **manually**. `pip install libraryName`

## <ins>How to Use</ins>

1.  Use **CMD** or **Terminal** to go to the project directory with the `cd` command. Or if you are using VSCode and you opened the project in VSCode, if you open the terminal in the editor, it will open directly in the project directory.
2.  Enter `python3 main.py` in the command line to access the **main menu**.
3.  From the main menu, enter the **digit** at the beginning of the related topic as <ins>direct input</ins> to the command line.
4.  When entering the data set into the command line, be careful to put <ins>**commas**</ins> between each data and <ins>**not to put a comma after the last data**</ins>!
